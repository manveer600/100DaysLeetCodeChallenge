# QUESTION 37:- Palindrome Number
# DESCRIPTION:- Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.
# EXAMPLE1:-
  Input: x = 121
  Output: true
  Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

# EXAMPLE2:-
  Input: x = -121
  Output: false
  Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

# SOLUTION 37:- 
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPalindrome(int x) {
        if(x<0){
            return false;
        }

        long long reverse = 0;
        int original = x; 
        while(x>0){
            reverse = reverse*10+x%10;
            x=x/10;
        } 

        return reverse == original;
    }
};
