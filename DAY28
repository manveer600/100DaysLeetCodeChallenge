# QUESTION 43:- Check if a String Is an Acronym of Words
# DESCRIPTION:- Given an array of strings words and a string s, determine if s is an acronym of words.
The string s is considered an acronym of words if it can be formed by concatenating the first character of each string in words in order. For example, "ab" can be formed from ["apple", "banana"], but it can't be formed from ["bear", "aardvark"].
Return true if s is an acronym of words, and false otherwise.

# EXAMPLE1:-
  Input: words = ["alice","bob","charlie"], s = "abc"
  Output: true
  Explanation: The first character in the words "alice", "bob", and "charlie" are 'a', 'b', and 'c', respectively. Hence, s = "abc" is the acronym. 

 # EXAMPLE2:-
  Input: words = ["an","apple"], s = "a"
  Output: false
  Explanation: The first character in the words "an" and "apple" are 'a' and 'a', respectively. 
  The acronym formed by concatenating these characters is "aa". 
  Hence, s = "a" is not the acronym.

# SOLUTION 43:- 
class Solution {
public:
    bool isAcronym(vector<string>& words, string s) {
        string str;
        for(int i =  0; i < words.size() ; i++){
            string word = words[i];
            str.push_back(word[0]);
        }

        return str == s;
    }
};
